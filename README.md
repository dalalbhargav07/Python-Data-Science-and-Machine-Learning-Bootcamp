# Python-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp

This comprehensive [course](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp) was helpful in learning how to use the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms. This course has also help me to develop thinking like a data scientist.

Following were the few of the topics covered in the course: 

* **Programming with Python**
* **NumPy with Python**
* **Using pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks**
* **Use pandas to handle Excel Files**
* **Web scraping with python**
* **Connect Python to SQL**
* **Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations**
* **Use plotly for interactive visualizations**
* **Machine Learning with SciKit Learn, including:**
    * **Linear Regression**
    * **K Nearest Neighbors**
    * **K Means Clustering**
    * **Decision Trees**
    * **Random Forests**
    * **Natural Language Processing**
    * **Neural Nets and Deep Learning(TensorFLow)**
    * **Support Vector Machines**

I am thankful to **Jose Portilla** for teaching the course well.
